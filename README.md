# Recommendations_IBM
This is a project I completed for my data science nano degree with Udacity

The files are set up to run as is, just click through the cells of the notebook in order without skipping anything. 

The main code--in fact, the only code I have written--is in the Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb file. It goes thorugh the basices of collaborative recommendation systems with a file of interactions between users of the IBM Data Science platform and articles available to users. Each line of the data set records an interaction between the a user and an article. There can be multiple interactions between a user and an article and each article can, of course, be accessed by multiple users. 

The task is to come up with recommendations for a user based on the articles they have thus far interacted with.
